> A backend with a NestJS framework. 

That's a college's project, which objective is doing a system for controll the stock of a geek articles store.

#### Technologies:
- **NestJS**: a JS framework.
- **Typeorm**: a ORM framework.
- **PostgreSQL**: the database used.
- **Postman**: used for test the API's endpoint.
- **Beekeeper Studio.**: the database's editor.

For a while, the system is still being done, so this readme won't contain many things. 

A principle, I would like to thanks the NestJS documentantion, TypeORM and Postgres, as well. There is nothig better than a great and well done documentation.6
